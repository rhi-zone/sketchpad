# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the sketchpad repository.

## Project Overview

Pure Rust inference engine for diffusion models (SD 1.x, SDXL, Flux, SD3, video) and LLMs (Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, Gemma, Phi, Qwen, DeepSeek, RWKV, Mamba, Jamba). Built on Burn framework. No Python — loads safetensors and GGUF directly.

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Core Rules

**Note things down immediately — no deferral:**
- Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response
- Design decisions, key insights → docs/ or CLAUDE.md
- Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code, not after
- **Every observed problem → TODO.md. No exceptions.** Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items. If you write a TODO comment in source, the next action is to open TODO.md and write the entry.

**Conversation is not memory.** Anything said in chat evaporates at session end. If it implies a future behavior change, write it to CLAUDE.md immediately — or it will not happen.

**Warning — these phrases mean something needs to be written down right now:**
- "I won't do X again" / "I'll remember to..." / "I've learned that..."
- "Next time I'll..." / "From now on I'll..."
- Any acknowledgement of a recurring error without a corresponding CLAUDE.md edit

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**When the user corrects you:** Ask what rule would have prevented this, and write it before proceeding. **"The rule exists, I just didn't follow it" is never the diagnosis** — a rule that doesn't prevent the failure it describes is incomplete; fix the rule, not your behavior.

**Corrections are documentation lag, not model failure.** When the same mistake recurs, the fix is writing the invariant down — not repeating the correction. Every correction that doesn't produce a CLAUDE.md edit will happen again. Exception: during active design, corrections are the work itself — don't prematurely document a design that hasn't settled yet.

**Something unexpected is a signal, not noise.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, files containing what they shouldn't — stop and ask why before continuing. Don't accept anomalies and move on.

**Do the work properly.** Don't leave workarounds or hacks undocumented. When asked to analyze X, actually read X — don't synthesize from conversation.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**Always commit completed work.** After tests pass, commit immediately — don't wait to be asked. When a plan has multiple phases, commit after each phase passes. Do not accumulate changes across phases. Uncommitted work is lost work.

**Use `normalize view` for structural exploration:**
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Context Management

**Use subagents to protect the main context window.** For broad exploration or mechanical multi-file work, delegate to an Explore or general-purpose subagent rather than running searches inline. The subagent returns a distilled summary; raw tool output stays out of the main context.

Rules of thumb:
- Research tasks (investigating a question, surveying patterns) → subagent; don't pollute main context with exploratory noise
- Searching >5 files or running >3 rounds of grep/read → use a subagent
- Codebase-wide analysis (architecture, patterns, cross-file survey) → always subagent
- Mechanical work across many files (applying the same change everywhere) → parallel subagents
- Single targeted lookup (one file, one symbol) → inline is fine

## Session Handoff

Use plan mode as a handoff mechanism when:
- A task is fully complete (committed, pushed, docs updated)
- The session has drifted from its original purpose
- Context has accumulated enough that a fresh start would help

**For handoffs:** enter plan mode, write a plan containing only: next tasks, blocked/pending items, and what was done this session (only if it directly affects what comes next). Nothing else — no commands, no build steps, no context summaries. Those belong in CLAUDE.md or TODO.md. The next session reads both fresh. **Do NOT investigate first** — the session is context-heavy and about to be discarded.

**Initiate a handoff after a significant mid-session correction.** When a correction happens after substantial wrong-path work, the wrong reasoning is still in context and keeps pulling. Writing down the invariant and starting fresh beats continuing with poisoned context — the next session loads the invariant from turn 1 before any wrong reasoning exists.

**For mid-session planning** on a different topic: investigating inside plan mode is fine — context isn't being thrown away.

**TODO.md is the lossless record.** Flush any new items to TODO.md before the handoff. Anything worth preserving belongs in CLAUDE.md or TODO.md.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Use Claude Code's auto-memory system (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`) — it is unversioned, invisible to the user, and can't be diffed or backed up. Write behavioral changes and project context directly to CLAUDE.md instead
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead
- Write preamble or summary in generated content
- Catch generic errors - catch specific error types
- Create special cases - design to avoid them; if stuck, ask user rather than special-casing
- Deprecate things - no users, just remove
- **Return tuples from functions** - use structs with named fields. Tuples obscure meaning and cause ordering bugs. Only use tuples when names would be pure ceremony (e.g., `(x, y)` coordinates).
- **Replace content when editing lists** - when adding to TODO.md or similar, extend existing content, don't replace sections.
- **Mark as done prematurely** - if work is incomplete, note what remains in TODO.md.
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** HashMap > inventory crate. OnceLock > lazy_static. Functions > traits until you need the trait. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling. "Going in circles" = signal to simplify, not add complexity.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

**When stuck (2+ failed attempts):**
- Step back and reconsider the problem itself, not just try more solutions.
- Ask: "Am I solving the right problem?"

## Working Style

Agentic by default - continue through tasks unless:
- Genuinely blocked and need clarification
- Decision has significant irreversible consequences
- User explicitly asked to be consulted

When you say "do X first" or "then we can Y" - add it to TODO.md immediately. Don't just say it, track it.

Bail out early if stuck in a loop rather than burning tokens.

## Commits

Commit consistently. Each commit = one logical change.
Avoid tiny commits - batch related changes unless they're truly independent logical units.
